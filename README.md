## Hey ! 🎮




**I’m İrem!**

- I'm a Psychology graduate. I am a Game Design master's student at Bahçeşehir University and also a Computer Programming student at Kocaeli University.

- I am working on various projects to develop myself in the field of game software. With my education in psychology and game design, I analyze different game types in terms of software, UX, and design.

- In my projects, I adhere to **SOLID Principles** to ensure clean and maintainable code. I develop **Event-Based Systems** to enhance game functionality and responsiveness. To manage data efficiently, I utilize **Scriptable Objects**.  Additionally, I leverage **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles**, including **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **abstraction**, and **polymorphism**, to create flexible and scalable architectures.

🧠 My motto in game development is: **"If there's a recurring pattern, think about it mathematically."**
